                    </h3>
                    <p class="subtopics">In today's world, the way we use energy is causing big problems all around the
                        globe. The fuels<br><br>
                        we usually use are making the environment really sick. This is making the weather go all crazy
                        and it's hurting nature.<br><br>

                        We've been using fuels that come from old things in the ground for a very long time. These fuels
                        have helped us grow, but they're making the planet really unwell. They let out gases that make
                        the air too warm, causing lots of bad weather and making nature unbalanced.<br><br>

                        But there's some good news! There are these amazing special fuels that don't hurt the planet.
                        They can help us fix the mess we've made with our usual fuels. These new fuels come from things
                        like plants, and they don't make the air dirty. Some are like the batteries in our toys, and
                        they're getting better and lasting longer.<br><br>

                        These special fuels are super important because they can stop the Earth from getting too warm
                        and fix some of the big problems we've made. They come in different types, like fuels made from
                        plants and even those used to power cars without polluting the air.<br><br>

                        The change to these new fuels is a big deal. It's like a promise from all of us to take care of
                        our planet. This is our way of making sure we live in a healthier and more sustainable world.

                        using again and again, unlike the ones that can run out and harm the Earth.<br><br>

                        They're called eco-friendly because they're kinder to nature. They come from things like plants
                        or waste and don't make the air and water dirty like our regular fuels do. These special fuels
                        don't cause as much harm to the environment.<br><br>

                        The best part is that they don't run out like the fuels we're using now. They mostly come from
                        things that keep growing, unlike fossil fuels that will eventually finish. Also, when we use
                        these special fuels, they make less bad stuff that can hurt the air and water.<br><br>

                        Using these new fuels is super important because they can help us take care of our planet.
                        They're part of a bigger plan to use energy that doesn't make the Earth sick. And if more people
                        start using these cool fuels, we'll help make our planet healthier for the future.<br><br>

                            <b>Biofuels are special types of fuels made from living things like plants, cooking oil, or
                                even
                                waste. There are a few different kinds:</b><br>

                            <br>
                            <li><b>Ethanol</b>: It's made from things like corn or sugarcane and used in some cars as a
                                fuel.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Biodiesel</b>: This comes from oils in plants or even used cooking oil. It can work
                                in trucks or
                                some cars.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Biogas</b>: This fuel is produced from waste materials, like food scraps or manure,
                                and can be used
                                for heating or cooking.</li>
                            <br><b>Pros and cons</b>: Biofuels are great because they come from things that we can keep
                            growing, unlike
                            oil or gas. But making them can sometimes use a lot of water or land, which might not be
                            good
                            for the environment.

                            <br>
                            <li><b>Electrolysis</b>: It's like magic! We use electricity to split water into hydrogen
                                and oxygen.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Steam methane reforming</b>: This method takes natural gas and turns it into
                                hydrogen.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Using hydrogen</b>: It's used in some cars, buses, and even in some buildings for
                                energy. But
                                storing and moving hydrogen safely can be a bit tricky.</li>
                            <br><b>Pros and cons</b>: Hydrogen fuel offers clean energy but faces challenges such as
                            carbon emissions in production, energy intensity, and costly infrastructure. Overcoming
                            these hurdles is crucial for realizing its potential as a sustainable energy source.

                            <br>A city's public transportation system sought to reduce its environmental impact and
                            dependence on traditional fossil fuels. They decided to implement biodiesel, an eco-friendly
                            alternative made from renewable resources such as vegetable oils or animal fats.<br>
                            <br>

                                <br> The transportation company gradually replaced a portion of its diesel fuel with
                                biodiesel in its bus fleet. They collaborated with local biodiesel producers, ensuring a
                                sustainable and local supply chain. Educational campaigns were launched to inform the
                                public about the environmental benefits of biodiesel.

                    these initiatives, Not only has the university lowered the total power use from the conventional
                    resources, but it has also boosted the university’s renewable generation. In the year 2022, the
                    combined
                    emissions from scope 1 and scope 2 amount to nearly 3730 tonnes of CO2 equivalent for the 2021-22
                    session.
                    <br>
                    Energy Efficient Building: In an era of smart cities, sustainable buildings and contemporary
                    interiors,
                    University designed an energy-efficient building with specialized architects. They have also trained
                    our
                    students to become lateral thinkers by focusing on the critical design approach. With exposure to an
                    international environment, access to the latest tools, software’s and technology, our students also
                    become architects that create buildings and infrastructure that are globally acknowledged. Due to
                    the
                    incorporation of energy-efficient building strategies, the energy consumption density of the LPU
                    buildings is much lower than a 5-star rated building by Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Government of
                    India.
                    <br>
                    Green transportation: Solar power bus and battery-operated e-rickshaw in the campus are operating
                    since
                    2017. 22 e-rickshaws service connecting its major buildings, departments, hostels for students and
                    faculty members. Nearly 100 Km mileage is giving by each e-rickshaw. In this way, the university
                    strives
                    to combat the detrimental carbon-emitting conventional fuel vehicles and helping towards the
                    improvement
                    of air quality at the micro-level.
                    <br>
                    Solar Irrigation System: The University installed three solar-powered irrigation systems and also
                    used
                    in lawns , gardens for watering the plants. Each unit has a five- horsepower capacity. These motors
                    are
                    used in drip irrigation systems to irrigate orchards. This system is extremely efficient in terms of
                    reducing water loss and making efficient use of energy and water resources.
                    <br>
                    Biogas plant: Organic waste can be collected and used to make biogas, a renewable source of energy,
                    to
                    minimize greenhouse gas emissions and the danger of pollution to rivers. Biogas is made up of about
                    50%
                    to 70% methane, 30% to 40% carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases In this regard, the
                    University has three 3-cubic-meter biogas systems in operation across campus which processes and
                    treats
                    kitchen waste.
                    <br>
                    Centralized Chiller Plant: The University replaced split and window air conditioners in
                    administrative
                    buildings with a 265 TR centralized chiller water-based cooling system. When compared to
                    conventional
                    air conditioners, the new system uses 40% less electricity. The university has a strategy for
                    lowering
                    energy usage by scheduling the running duration of air conditioning devices during the day and
                    during
                    peak summer months.
